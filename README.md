- 💻 I work a bit on the weekends. This is my choice. I do not expect people to work on the weekend. I might chat people things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until work begins on Monday.
- 🏉 I love watching rugby, i do not play anymore after some serious injuries, that's life.
- My Rugby career is over (has it begun someday? 😄 ) and now i really enjoy running! 🏃‍
